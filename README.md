# The project objective

I've been trying to make a real life example of a comment section using ReactJS using the json-server lib to mock an API, but it is very limited for not alowing me to access nested resources within my json.db file, i haven't figured out how to solve this issue. So for now consider this project as a practice for React concepts and web design only and not a fully functional comment section
